## UiPath re-usable components (plug &amp; play)

This is meant to speed up development time by just dragging and dropping these dynamic workflows into your project and just changing the variables and parameter to suite your need.

The components are uploaded in folders and inside each, there is a readme file describing the component. 

and if you need support or have a question or anything, please feel free to get it touch all my details are in my profile.
