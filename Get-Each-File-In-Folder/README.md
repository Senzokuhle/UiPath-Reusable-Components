# GetFilesInDiractory
This simple workflow goes into a folder with documens:

Prints the total number of files with .pdf extenton
prints each file name without extention
prints path to each file

depending on your use case you can just delete whatever you do not need.

If you are working with a different set of file e.g images, just inside the value of the first assign activity (Assign - List of all) and 
change the extention from .pdf to .png or whatever file extention you are working with.
