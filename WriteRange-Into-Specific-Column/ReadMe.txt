This workflow read two files, File1 and File2

File2 only has column names and no data

The bot compare the column names from both files and if it finds a macthing
column name it pastes the data from the file1 into file2 to the matching column

clear the range on file2 and run the bot, you will notice the data gets written into 
the right columns.
